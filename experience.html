                            to event organization and, most importantly, serve the community.</p>

                            became the starting point of my publication journey. 
                            Qualifying as a cartoonist through examinations, this period marked 
                            the inception of a meaningful chapter in my artistic development.</p>

                            the world of digital art and started learning more about digital art where 
                            it soon became my forte, making it a memorable and transformative experience.</p>
